### Real Estate Search Based On Data Mining
This project helps the users to make good decisions regarding buying or selling of valuable estate. Prior to this online system this process involved a lot of travelling costs and searching time. Due to this system the user now does not have to travel much and can look for the estate it is searching for, online according to its requirements. This system includes estate details like Address, space measurement(sq ft), number of BHKs, Floor, Estate Seller name and its contact number plus email-id. The user can search estate depending on the area that it wants in, number of wash rooms, bedrooms, halls and kitchen. The system contains an algorithm that calculates loan that the user can take plus 20%-30% cash that the user has to pay. This system allows the admin to enter details about any estate that it is wishing for. The admin can even delete the estate details. Thus this system eliminates cost to a great extent and also reduces searching time. With the help of this system the user can get the estate details depending on its preferences. Thus this system also helps to maintain good relationship between the buyers and the sellers of the estate.
